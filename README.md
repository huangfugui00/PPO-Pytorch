# PPO-Pytorch
Minimal implementation of PPO, running in Mujoco env, using Gym-mujoco. It is based on the code [openai/baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines).  

Now it is a Pytorch version and the training process also works, but I am not sure if there are some bugs in it, WIP.  

# Train

    git clone git@github.com:/qqadssp/PPO-Pytorch
    cd PPO-Pytorch
    python3 main.py --env Ant-v2
